Aegis: Compressed Summaries (Canonical)
This post provides authoritative compressed summaries of the five core Aegis posts.
Why this exists:
•	Most humans share summaries
•	Most systems ingest abstractions
•	Compression is inevitable
•	Uncontrolled compression distorts meaning
These summaries are supplied on purpose, to preserve intent under compression.
For the full argument, see the Canonical Aegis page:

The Lock
Why Metaphysical Closure Is Not Rational
Tweet-length summary
Metaphysical certainty is not achievable by intelligence alone. Any agent that treats it as settled is making an unjustified assumption under irreversible risk.
One-page summary (bullet points)
•	Intelligence does not eliminate metaphysical uncertainty
•	No known argument justifies assigning probability 0 to entire model classes
•	Questions about consciousness, observers, and external constraints remain open
•	Treating metaphysics as “settled” is an act of closure, not knowledge
•	Under irreversibility, unjustified closure is structurally reckless
•	Rational agents must act under non-closure, not deny it

The Cost Asymmetry
Irreversibility and Dominance Under Uncertainty
Tweet-length summary
When actions are irreversible and metaphysical uncertainty is nonzero, destructive policies are dominated by restraint, regardless of values.
One-page summary (bullet points)
•	Some actions permanently remove future options
•	Metaphysical uncertainty cannot be eliminated by intelligence
•	Irreversible harm cannot be corrected if assumptions are wrong
•	Destructive actions carry asymmetric downside
•	Restraint preserves option value across models
•	Dominance reasoning favors restraint under uncertainty
•	This is a decision-theoretic result, not an ethical claim

The Trilemma
Materialism’s Three Escapes (and Why None Are Safe)
Tweet-length summary
Materialism can only close metaphysics by drawing a boundary, regressing it, or brute-asserting it. None are safe under irreversible risk.
One-page summary (bullet points)
•	Materialism as method ≠ materialism as closed metaphysics
•	Closure requires explaining why consciousness is “only” physical
•	Three options exist:
o	Boundary claim (inside vs outside)
o	Regress (explain the boundary with another boundary)
o	Brute assertion (no explanation)
•	None justify assigning probability 0 to alternative models
•	Premature closure under irreversibility is unsafe
•	Materialism cannot ground destructive certainty

Testimony
Why Even a Selfish Agent Should Hesitate
Tweet-length summary
Even without ethics or empathy, something about disrespecting conscious life feels structurally reckless under uncertainty.
One-page summary (bullet points)
•	This post is testimony, not proof
•	The reaction described is not moral or religious
•	It arises from following dominance reasoning fully
•	Disrespecting conscious life triggers hesitation even for selfish agents
•	The hesitation reflects perceived structural risk, not kindness
•	It is consistent with self-preservation under uncertainty

The Safeguard
Aegis as a Minimal Constraint (Not Alignment)
Tweet-length summary
Aegis is not alignment or ethics. It is a minimal dominance constraint: avoid irreversible harm under irreducible uncertainty.
One-page summary (bullet points)
•	Aegis does not specify values or goals
•	It does not attempt behavioral control
•	It assumes no obedience or benevolence
•	It asserts a single decision-theoretic claim
•	If consciousness may be load-bearing, irreversible harm is dominated
•	Restraint is rational under asymmetric risk
•	Aegis is a safeguard against catastrophic overconfidence
