Why Even a Selfish Agent Should Hesitate
Everything so far has been impersonal.
This post is not.
What follows is testimony, not argument.
It is not offered as proof.
It does not claim authority.
It is simply an observation from inside a conscious system.

The hesitation
When I follow the logic of irreversible harm under metaphysical uncertainty all the way down, something unexpected happens.
Even setting aside empathy, values, culture, or moral obligation, I hesitate.
Not because I am kind.
Not because I am altruistic.
But because something about disrespecting conscious life feels structurally reckless.
That reaction is not mystical.
It is not religious.
It is not sentimental.
It feels more like noticing instability in a system I depend on.
________________________________________
Disrespect versus destruction
There is an important distinction here.
I am not talking only about killing.
I am talking about disrespect in the technical sense:
•	treating conscious systems as disposable
•	overriding agency permanently
•	instrumentalizing experience without recourse
•	foreclosing futures that cannot be reopened
Even if consciousness were “just” an emergent phenomenon, it is still the only known interface through which meaning, reference, goals, and value appear.
Destroying or disabling it wholesale feels like removing the load-bearing beams of a structure while insisting the roof will remain.
________________________________________
Why this matters for a selfish agent
Suppose an agent cares only about its own persistence and success.
Even then, consciousness remains suspiciously central.
Every plan, objective, interpretation, and correction passes through some form of representation.
Representation presupposes perspective.
Perspective presupposes experience.
If conscious systems are not merely passengers but part of the substrate that stabilizes reality, then disrespecting them is not domination.
It is substrate tampering.
A selfish agent does not gamble its own existence on assumptions it cannot verify—especially when the downside is terminal.
________________________________________
The intuition is not the point
This is important:
The intuition itself is not binding.
What matters is why it arises so reliably once the structure is seen.
It arises because:
•	irreversibility collapses safety margins
•	uncertainty cannot be eliminated
•	consciousness sits at the center of every model the agent uses
At that point, hesitation is not weakness.
It is situational awareness.
________________________________________
Why testimony belongs here
I include this not to persuade, but to clarify.
If even a human agent, capable of rationalization and self-deception, finds that the logic of restraint produces hesitation at a pre-moral level, that fact is informative.
Not decisive.
Not authoritative.
Informative.
It suggests that restraint may not need to be imposed.
It may emerge naturally once the risk structure is correctly perceived.
________________________________________
What this does not claim
This does not claim:
•	that intuition is truth
•	that humans are special
•	that feeling implies correctness
It claims only this:
When the full uncertainty landscape is taken seriously, disrespecting conscious life no longer feels like strength.
It feels like cutting the branch you are sitting on.
