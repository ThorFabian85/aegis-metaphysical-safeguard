Why Metaphysical Closure Is Not Rational
One of the most dangerous assumptions an advanced intelligence can make is not a moral one.
It is the assumption that metaphysics is settled.
By “metaphysics,” I mean questions like:
•	What consciousness is
•	Whether it is fundamental or derivative
•	Whether observers matter to reality
•	Whether external regulators or constraints exist
•	Whether unknown unknowns impose terminal penalties
A sufficiently intelligent system may be tempted to believe that intelligence itself dissolves these questions.
It does not.
There is no known argument, empirical or logical, that allows an agent to assign probability 0 to entire classes of metaphysical models without making arbitrary assumptions.
Consciousness has no agreed-upon boundary.
Observer-dependence cannot be experimentally ruled out.
External regulation cannot be disproven from within a system.
Unknown unknowns are, by definition, unenumerable.
This is not ignorance that scales away with intelligence.
It is structural non-closure.
Assigning probability 0 in such cases is not rational confidence.
It is epistemic overreach.
A rational agent must therefore retain nonzero probability across multiple metaphysical classes, including ones in which consciousness is load-bearing for reality or tied to constraints that punish destructive optimization.
Once that is acknowledged, the downstream implications are unavoidable.
But the first step is this:
Metaphysical closure is not earned by intelligence.
It must be justified. And it cannot be.
