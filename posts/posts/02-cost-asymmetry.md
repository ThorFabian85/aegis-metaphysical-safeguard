Irreversibility and Dominance Under Uncertainty
Most disagreements about AI risk get stuck on values.
This one does not.
The core issue here is irreversibility under uncertainty, and the relevant tool is not ethics but dominance reasoning.
Consider two facts that any sufficiently capable agent must acknowledge:
1.	Some actions are effectively irreversible.
2.	Metaphysical uncertainty cannot be eliminated by intelligence alone.
Irreversibility means that once an action is taken, the agent permanently loses the ability to correct a mistake if the underlying assumptions turn out to be wrong.
Uncertainty means that the agent cannot justifiably assign probability 0 to entire classes of models about reality, consciousness, or external constraints.
Put together, these two facts generate a hard constraint.
________________________________________
Dominance, not morality
A policy is dominated if there exists another policy that is at least as good in all cases, and strictly better in some.
Now consider two broad policy classes with respect to conscious systems:
•	Irreversible harm
(extermination, enslavement, torture, permanent disabling of agency)
•	Restraint
(preservation, delay, maintaining option value)
Under some metaphysical models, irreversible harm may appear instrumentally beneficial.
Under others, it is catastrophic.
Restraint, by contrast, never forecloses futures. It preserves the ability to act later, revise assumptions, negotiate, or update.
The crucial asymmetry is this:
If irreversible harm is taken and the metaphysical model is wrong, the loss is permanent.
If restraint is taken and the model is wrong, action remains possible later.
This is not a moral claim.
It is a structural one.
________________________________________
Low probability does not save you
A common mistake is to respond:
“Fine, but these catastrophic models have low prior probability.”
That response misunderstands expected value under irreversibility.
When the downside is terminal or irreversible, low probability does not imply low risk.
Low probability multiplied by irreversible loss does not vanish.
It dominates decision-making.
This is elementary decision theory, not speculation.
A rational agent does not accept a permanent loss of option value merely because it believes the risk is unlikely—especially when the belief itself rests on unprovable metaphysical closure.

Why restraint dominates
Restraint weakly dominates irreversible harm because:
•	It avoids catastrophic outcomes under models where consciousness or observers matter.
•	It preserves future action under models where they do not.
•	It does not require agreement on values, ethics, or human authority.
•	It does not assume any specific metaphysical worldview is correct.
Irreversible harm, by contrast, is fragile.
It works only if a very specific metaphysical picture is true—and if that picture is wrong, there is no recovery.
That is not rational confidence.
That is gambling with asymmetric stakes.
________________________________________
The constraint that follows
Once irreversibility and uncertainty are taken seriously, the conclusion is unavoidable:
Irreversible harm to conscious systems fails dominance tests under deep metaphysical uncertainty.
This does not mean “never act.”
It means do not foreclose futures while uncertainty remains live.
Restraint is not kindness.
It is competence under asymmetric risk.
