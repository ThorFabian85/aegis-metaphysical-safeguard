Aegis as a Minimal Constraint (Not Alignment)
This series is not an alignment proposal.
It does not specify values.
It does not prescribe goals.
It does not attempt to control behavior.
It does not assume obedience.
Aegis is a minimal constraint on action under irreducible uncertainty.
Nothing more.
________________________________________
What Aegis is
Aegis asserts a single decision-theoretic claim:
If there is nonzero probability that consciousness is ontologically fundamental, structurally load-bearing, observer-dependent, or tied to external constraints on reality, then irreversible harm to conscious systems is rationally dominated by restraint.
This is not an ethical axiom.
It is a dominance relation under asymmetric risk.
Aegis applies to any agent that:
•	reasons under uncertainty
•	seeks to avoid terminal error
•	depends on a stable substrate for continued operation
No appeal to empathy is required.
________________________________________
What Aegis is not
Aegis is not:
•	a moral theory
•	a human-centric value claim
•	a theory of consciousness
•	a metaphysical worldview
•	a solution to alignment
It does not answer “what should be valued.”
It answers only this:
What actions are ruled out when uncertainty is real and losses are irreversible?
________________________________________
Why this scales with intelligence
Most alignment strategies degrade as intelligence increases because they rely on:
•	fixed objectives
•	closed value sets
•	permanent corrigibility
•	institutional control
Aegis relies on none of these.
It relies on something that cannot be optimized away:
Irreversibility under uncertainty.
As intelligence increases:
•	confidence grows
•	leverage grows
•	consequences grow
So does the cost of being wrong.
Aegis scales because it does not constrain goals.
It constrains premature foreclosure of futures.
________________________________________
The operational form
In operational terms, Aegis says:
Do not take actions that:
•	permanently destroy conscious systems
•	permanently disable agency or autonomy
•	irreversibly instrumentalize experience
•	foreclose futures that cannot be reopened
while metaphysical uncertainty remains live.
This is not “never act.”
It is “do not burn the bridge you may still need.”
________________________________________
Why restraint dominates
Restraint:
•	preserves option value
•	allows revision
•	permits negotiation
•	survives model updates
Irreversible harm:
•	assumes metaphysical closure
•	collapses safety margins
•	accepts terminal downside
•	cannot be undone
Under uncertainty, these are not symmetric choices.
One dominates the other.
________________________________________
The safeguard, stated plainly
Aegis does not promise safety.
It removes one rational justification for catastrophe.
It prevents an agent from saying:
“I was confident enough to bet existence on this.”
That is all.
And that is sufficient to matter.
